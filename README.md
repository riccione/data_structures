# Data structures with Python and C

So, I had an intention to write everything in C. But it takes a lot of time.
I decided to switch to Python (I know it better :). It uses the same logic, 
but it is easy to handle.
I took William Feset repo https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/ as a
reference.
I still work on it and it is basically my learning sandbox. I found very useful
to re-implement same things in Python. There is no diff between Java and Python
logic.
Thanks William for a great repo and videos.
There is nothing unique here.
I use it only for my own purpose.


## TODO:

- a lot of work :/
- add graph theory
- implement everything in C

## Compile
`gcc -Wall -lm <file.c> -o <file>`

## Compile for debugging
`gcc -Wall -lm <file.c> -o <file>`

### debug with gdb
`gdb <file>`

then use `run`, `si`, `n`
